	            <h2>Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children</h2>
	            <img src="assets/images/cover1.jpg" class="center">
	            <p>Abe Portman has told stories to his grandson Jake about battling monsters and spending his childhood at "Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children" at Cairnholm, an island off the coast of Wales. The home's children and their headmistress, Miss Alma Peregrine, possess paranormal abilities and are known as "Peculiars". One day, Jake finds Abe dying with his eyes removed, and he tells Jake to go to "the loop of September 3, 1943".</p>
				<p>Following advice from Dr. Golan, Jake travels to the United Kingdom to go to Cairnholm with his father Frank to investigate the children’s home, learning that it was destroyed during a Luftwaffe raid. Upon entering the ruins, Jake finds children from Abe's stories. They take him through a portal and he emerges in the year 1943, when the house was still intact. Miss Peregrine greets him and explains that she belongs to a class of female Peculiars named "Ymbrynes", who can transform into birds (in Miss Peregrine's case, a peregrine falcon) and manipulate time. To avoid persecution for being Peculiars, she and her children hide from the outside world in a time loop she created, accessible only to Peculiars and set to September 3, 1943, allowing them to live the same day repeatedly and avoid aging as long as they stay inside it.</p>
				<p>Jake is introduced to the rest of the children, including aerokinetic Emma Bloom, who he is attracted to. Jake learns he is also a Peculiar like his grandfather, and can see the invisible monsters from Abe's stories, which are called "Hollowgasts" (or "Hollows"). They are disfigured Peculiar scientists who killed an Ymbryne in a failed experiment to harvest her powers trying to achieve immortality. Led by shapeshifter Mr. Barron, they hunt Peculiars to consume their eyeballs, which allow them to regain visibly human form, but with milky-white eyes, named "Wights".</p>
				<p>A wounded Ymbryne named Miss Avocet arrives, explaining Barron assaulted her in the January 2016 time loop at Blackpool, England, killing her children and is trying to repeat the failed experiment using more Ymbrynes. Miss Peregrine prepares to move out with her children and Miss Avocet, after learning from Jake that a Hollow may be on the island in the present after sheep were killed. Jake returns to 2016, but finding an elderly man killed by the Hollow, he goes back to the portal to warn them the Hollow is near. However, he is followed by another visitor on the island, an ornithologist who is actually Mr. Barron.</p>
				<p>Barron had tried to extract the location of Ms. Peregrine's loop from Abe, but his hungry Hollow companion, Mr. Malthus (the one on the island), killed Abe before he could do so. He then posed as Dr. Golan, encouraging Jake to go to the island so he could lead him to the loop. Using Jake as a hostage at the children's home, Barron forces Miss Peregrine to trap herself in bird form and takes her to Blackpool, leaving Jake, the other children, and Miss Avocet as prey for Malthus.</p>
				<p>Malthus arrives and kills Miss Avocet, but Jake and the children escape just as the Luftwaffe raid destroys the house, killing Malthus. Without Miss Peregrine to reset it, the loop closes, leaving them stuck in 1943. Rescuing a sunken ocean liner, they travel to Blackpool and enter its January 2016 loop, fight Barron's Wight and Hollow allies, and rescue Miss Peregrine and other captive Ymbrynes. Barron disguises himself as Jake, hoping to confuse the children who have come to finish him off. But when the last remaining Hollow arrives, Jake is able to see and avoid it. The Hollow kills Barron and is in turn killed by Jake.</p>
				<p>Before the time loop closes, Jake says goodbye to the children as they exit and return to their ship in 1943 while he stays in 2016, travels to Florida and relates his adventures to Abe, who is alive and well: Barron's death in the beginning of 2016 erased his presence in Florida later on. Abe gives Jake a map of international time loops, allowing Jake to reunite with his friends and Emma in 1943. They declare their feelings for each other and kiss. The children and Miss Peregrine sail their own ship, seeking a happy time loop.</p>

	            <h2>Hollow City</h2>
	            <img src="assets/images/cover2.jpg" class="center">
	            <p>After fleeing in a boat from the hollowgasts, the peculiar children are caught up in a bad storm and need to find land. They land on a beach only to find that the wights are trying to track them down, so they flee into the forests of the mainland. With nowhere to run, the group wander aimlessly, until they find a statue from The Tales of the Peculiar. There, they discover a time loop with the help of their book The Tales of the Peculiar and escape into it. Surprisingly, it is full of peculiar animals, who embrace and thank them for killing a hollow which had for a long time roamed in the time loop. After learning that Miss Wren, the ymbryne of this unique menagerie time loop, had flown to London to rescue her other fellow ymbrynes, the peculiar children leave in search of her, in hopes that she can turn Miss Peregrine back into a human, before her human self is lost forever. They travel with Gypsies whose leader has a peculiar son.</p>
				<p>While trying to board a train, they are ambushed by wights and held in a small shed at gunpoint until Hugh, who had managed to evade capture, used the bees in his stomach to save his friends. The group then continue on their journey and intercept the train to board, and find Miss Peregrine, whom they had accidentally left on the train in Bronwyn's trunk previously.</p>
				<p>In the city, they see horrible things left by bombings as they search for Miss Wren's flock of peculiar pigeons, which the group believes can lead them to her; they find a peculiar girl named Sam who can suffer bad injuries and be OK but she doesn't survive the war. They manage to make it to Saint Paul's Cathedral thanks to the book, where they enter an underground crypt and find two peculiar children named Joel and Peter who are echolocators and seem to share one mind. The brothers lead them to where the pigeons normally stay and only Emma, Jacob, and Horace enter following the flutter of pigeons wings up to the attic where they meet an aggressive girl named Melina Manon who is a peculiar teenager gifted with telekinesis. Initially, Melina distrusts them but after Horace proves his peculiarity, begs to travel with them, bringing a peculiar pigeon that they believe will lead them to Miss Wren. They finally reach a time loop under the pigeon's guidance that leads them to Miss Wren however the pigeon was killed by 'miss peregrine.' Miss Wren is hiding in a building coated in thick ice to prevent wights from entering and proceeds to help Miss Peregrine retain her human form once again, which she estimates will take the whole night. Meanwhile, Jacob, Millard and Emma deduce that the wights are extracting peculiar souls and feeding them to hollowgasts, allowing them to attain the ability to pass through time loops.</p>
				<p>Miss Wren is finally able to allow Miss Peregrine to change back into human form, but everyone is shocked to find out that the falcon is not Miss Peregrine at all, but her brother Caul, a wight. He reveals that it was himself and not Miss Peregrine that the children rescued from the submarine and that he has been following them to gain access to Miss Wren's menagerie and find Miss Wren herself, the only ymbryne that had managed to evade capture. Contacting the other wights, they proceed to kidnap every peculiar person in the building. While being marched away, Jacob manages to buy Emma time for her to melt their cuffs and escape into a phone booth in the present, where Jacob uses his cell phone to call his father to reassure him that he is alive, and discovering he has yet another hidden talent apart from seeing hollowgasts – the ability to speak to and control them as well.</p>

            	<h2>Library of Souls</h2>
            	<img src="assets/images/cover3.jpg" class="center">
				<p>After the events of the previous novel's ending, in which Jacob and Emma hide in a phone booth with Addison, Jacob discovers he has the ability to control hollowgasts as well as see them, Jacob then makes the hollow he's currently controlling back off, making it possible for the three to escape from the phone booth they're trapped in. They rest and prepare for the journey to rescue their friends and the kidnapped ymbrynes. The group manages to narrow down where their friends may have been taken and, with the help of a boatsman named Sharon, they cross over a polluted river by the name of Fever Ditch to a dilapidated village corrupted with drugs and run by the wights (Devil's Acre).</p>
				<p>There Addison is captured, and Jacob and Emma are shocked to find many peculiar people who have become trapped there and, in some cases, have put themselves up for viewing and sale. The worst of these peculiars have also become addicted to a specific drug known as ambrosia, which is taken by being poured into the eyes and is supposed to imbue the taker with great physical strength. This has led to frequent fights and matches between peculiars and hollows, where the peculiars take the ambrosia to further augment their abilities. While trying to navigate their way around without being spotted, they are invited into a man's house to take cover. The man, Bentham, is revealed to be the one who caused the explosion in the Siberian tundra that created hollows and essentially wights (as told in the first book), and he is also Miss Peregrine's brother.</p>
				<p>To prove that he truly wants to help, he unveils secret information about the wights and helps Jacob and Emma get into the wights' building using a hollow Jacob rescued from a cage in the fighting ring. The pair sneak into the building and manage to evade capture, but they also stumble upon a hospital complex where many peculiars are having their peculiar souls drained, including Melina and the echolocators. The other peculiar children, however, are nowhere to be found.</p>
				<p>Emma and Jacob proceed to stop the draining operations, and successfully find their friends in a basement cell and free them, save Fiona who had supposedly died when the hollows and wights invaded the loop where the peculiar menagerie were living. With no time to mourn, the group come across the room where all the ymbrynes are being kept, but Caul already knows that Jacob and Emma are here. He then threatens to release a whole horde of hollows into the room with them and the ymbrynes unless Jacob is willing to use his ability to help him find the soul jars hidden in the legendary Library of Souls - a place where it was rumored peculiars kept their souls after their death for others to borrow later, but was later cut off from the rest of peculiardom after a horrible war that was also responsible for scattering peculiars across the world.</p>
				<p>Despite that, Jacob does not give in to Caul's demands and instead uses his ability to control the hollows. The group then frees Miss Peregrine and the rest of the trapped ymbrynes and fight their way through the building. The peculiar children manage to keep up a good fight, but in the end are betrayed by Bentham, who wanted nothing more than to prove he could do some good for Miss Peregrine after she banished him, but sought revenge after she refused to forgive him. Caul takes the rest of the peculiars and ymbrynes hostage and forces them along with him to the Library of Souls, which Caul had managed to successfully rediscover. Here it is discovered that like his grandfather before him, Jacob is the only one who can see the soul jars hidden within the library. With Caul holding his friends hostage, Jacob obediently procures the most powerful soul jars for Caul and his brother, with the other wights dying because of ingesting the souls like ambrosia and not pouring them into a well where the souls can successfully bond with the user. Miss Peregrine's brothers grow into gigantic monsters who eventually end up dueling each other, but thanks to a recipe given to Jacob by Bentham that's used by the ymbrynes as the fight goes on, the library collapses in on Caul and Bentham.</p>
				<p>With the help of Miss Peregrine and Emma following along with them, Jacob returns to his home, where his parents and a new psychiatrist are waiting for him, wanting to know what happened. Miss Peregrine and Emma tell them what happened before Miss Peregrine makes them forget, for the time being, everything that had just been told to them. Jacob and Emma decide to keep a regular correspondence with each other, but this later fails as his parents find a few of Emma's letters and assume Jacob wrote them to himself. They decide to send him to a mental asylum, but on the night they're supposed to leave, Miss Peregrine and her peculiar children come and visit Jacob, affirming his insistence to his shocked parents that the peculiars are indeed real. It is also revealed that, because of the loop closing around them, the internal time clocks of the peculiars have been restored so that they no longer have to worry about the years they've lived in loops catching up to them - they age like regular human beings while being in the present. Closing the book, Emma and Jacob decide to keep being friends for the time being before taking things slow in properly restarting their romantic relationship, now that they have time enough to do so.</p>
